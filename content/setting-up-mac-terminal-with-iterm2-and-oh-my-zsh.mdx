title: Setting up Mac Terminal with iTerm2 and Oh My Zsh

After finishing the configuration of **SSH** and **Git**, I hope to use a Mac terminal with an elegant theme. 
To fulfill this purpose, I decided to use **iTerm2** as the terminal and 
manage **Zsh** configuration via **Oh My Zsh**.

## Install iTerm2

Install [iTerm2](https://ohmyz.sh/#install), then open and configure its `Profile` (color presets) like below.

**Zsh** is the default shell program on **MacOS** and you can check the current shell by following the command line:

```bash
echo $SHELL
/bin/zsh
```

## Install Oh My Zsh

To install **Oh My Zsh**, Runn the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

## Configure Oh My Zsh

Open `~/.zshrc` to modify `ZSH_THEME="robbyrussell"` to `ZSH_THEME="agnoster"`.

```bash
# Set name of the theme to load --- if set to "random", it will
# load a random theme each time Oh My Zsh is loaded, in which case,
# to know which specific one was loaded, run: echo $RANDOM_THEME
# See https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes
ZSH_THEME="agnoster"
```

## Install Powerline Fonts

To install Powerline fonts, you can just copy, paste, and run these commands to your terminal.

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/powerline/fonts.git --depth=1
# install
cd fonts
./install.sh
# clean-up a bit
cd ..
rm -rf fonts
```

then configure `Font` (Meslo LG M DZ for Powerline) in **iTerm2** as below:

## Install Oh My Zsh Plugins

Clone `zsh-autosuggestions` and `zsh-syntax-highlighting` into $ZSH_CUSTOM/plugins (by default ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting.git ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

Add the plugin to the list of plugins for **Oh My Zsh** to load (inside ~/.zshrc):

```bash
plugins=( 
    git
    zsh-autosuggestions
    zsh-syntax-highlighting
)
```

After runing `source ~/.zshrc`, you will see as below.

However, I cannot normally use `brew` it after installing **Oh My Zsh**. 
Then I figured out that when installing **Oh My Zsh**, 
it moves all contents of the existingÂ `.zshrc` file into a new file it creates called `~/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh`.

To solve this issue, I add the following commands into `.zshrc` as below:

```bash
# Old configuration
if [ -f "$HOME/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh" ]; then
    source "$HOME/.zshrc.pre-oh-my-zsh"
fi
```

## Customize Keyboard Shortcuts on MacOS

When I used the terminal on **Ubuntu**, there was a keyboard shortcut, `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `T`, which helped me quickly open a terminal. 
But there is no same shortcut on **MacOS**. Thus, I need to customize the keyboard shortcut as the same as on **Ubuntu**.

To customize the keyboard shortcut, click `System Setting` > `Keyboard` > `Keyboard Shortcuts` > `App Shortcuts` > `+`.

Then I configured the shortcut as follows:

And it works.
