title: Building MDX Blog with Contentlayer and Next.js

Recently, I'm rebuilding my personal blog using Next.js. I'm almost down except for the content management part. Using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) or headless CMS? That's a question.

After trying both of them, I prefer to use MDX instead of headless CMS.
Because I don't like spending too much time to learn how to use a platform.

## Comparison of MDX integration strategies

I had tried `@next/mdx`, `next-mdx-remote` and [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/) to integrate MDX with my Next.js blog and summarized their differences.

### @next/mdx

In the beginning, I used `@next/mdx` to render MDX posts.
It can be setup easily on my Next.js project with following the official [docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/using-mdx) and [blog](https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown#sharing-layout).
However, there are some drawbacks in this solution:

- `@next/mdx` does not support YAML front matter by default. You have to add frontmatter parser yourself, such as `gray-matter`.
- `@next/mdx` can only render MDX files locally, not using the remote files source including other Git repositories, databases, APIs or anywhere else.

The default rendering mode of MDX files using `@next/mdx` is Static Site Generation (SSG) in Next.js. We can see that by running the official [example](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/examples/with-mdx), `with-mdx`.

```

### next-remote-mdx

`next-mdx-remote` is a set of utilities to help work with MDX in Next.js projects.

Comparing with`@next/mdx`, there are some differences between the two.

- `next-mdx-remote` allow content to be loaded from anywhere, rather than only in local Next.js project.
- `next-mdx-remote` can be loaded with `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps` and hydrated correctly on the client.

However, `next-mdx-remote` and `@next/mdx` does not handle loading content from sources,
which means you have to do loading MDX files, generating JSON data that contains content, metadata, etc, and passing these as `props` into page components, by yourself.

### ContentLayer

Contentlayer is a content SDK that validates and transforms your content into type-safe JSON data you can easily import into your application's pages.

Here are some things that Contentlayer can do but `@next/mdx` and `next-mdx-remote` cannot:

- Support live reload (HMR) on content changes
- Transform content into data based on designed content model, powered by schema DSL
- Auto validates content and generate TypeScript type definitions based on content model

Comparing three popular ways of using MDX with Next.js, I chose Contentlayer as content management tool finally.

## Using ContentLayer in Next.js

### 1. Create Next.js Project with Tailwind CSS

Following this article, [Create a Next.js App with Tailwind CSS](/blog/create-a-nextjs-app-with-tailwind-css), to create new Next.js project and add Tailwind to it.

### 2. Install and Configure Contentlayer with Next.js

Following this [tutorial](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs/getting-started), you can build a simple Next.js blog site using Contentlayer.

### 3. Customize Project as You Needs

Now this blog had integrated with Contentlayer already, you can refer to the [source code](https://github.com/shenlu89/shenlu89.github.io) if you like.
