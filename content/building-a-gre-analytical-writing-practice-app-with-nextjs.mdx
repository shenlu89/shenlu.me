title: Building a GRE Analytical Writing Practice App with Next.js

It's been nearly six months since I published my last post, *[It's Time to Build in Public](/blog/it-is-time-to-build-in-public)*. During this time, I’ve been fully immersed in preparing for the GRE, which left me little time to follow through on the "Build in Public" mindset I once set out to embrace. But now, as I reach a new milestone, it’s the perfect time to revisit that idea—with a new project to share, **GRE GO**.

## Why I Built This App?

One of the most challenging aspects of GRE prep for me was writing. I hadn’t practiced academic writing in a long time, and rapidly improving my skills meant I needed to write—a lot. Fortunately, GRE writing topics come from a publicly available pool. That means that I knew exactly what topics could appear on the test.

However, while the topics were available, I couldn’t find a tool that allowed me to efficiently practice writing for these topics. What I needed was a tool that could:

- Randomly select topics from a customizable range.
- Simulate the actual test environment, including timed sessions.
- Allow me to search topics by keywords or writing tasks.

Since I couldn’t find a tool like this online, I decided to build one myself—a simple web app tailored specifically for efficient GRE writing practice. I used it regularly for about a month and, ultimately, it helped me achieve a score I was happy with.

## From Personal Tool to Public Product

After finishing the GRE, I decided to turn this internal tool into something others could use too. I redesigned the app with a broader audience in mind, and added a few new features beyond my original needs:

- Open-source, free to use and no login required.
- Local data storage. Writing history and preferences are saved right in browser.
- Custom tagging and highlighting, which can mark topics to revisit.

Responsive design. Works great on both desktop and mobile.

## Design Philosophy

The GRE writing pool currently contains 158 topics. I converted the entire pool into a lightweight JSON file, totaling less than 80KB. Even if we estimate each essay response at around 600 words, the data footprint remains extremely small:

70KB (writing pool) + 158 × 600 words ÷ 1024 = roughly 160KB

Given this minimal data size, there’s really no need to build a full backend or database. Instead, I chose to store all data—including user settings and writing history—directly in the browser using **localStorage** (5M-10M). This approach ensures that the app is fast, simple, and completely private, while still preserving user data across sessions.

## Tech Stack

Here's what powers the app:

- **Next.js 15** – Full-stack React framework with app router
- **Zustand** – Lightweight state management, using localStorage for persistence
- **Fuse.js** – Fuzzy search for topics queries
- **Headless UI** – Accessible UI components
- **Tailwind CSS 4** – Modern utility-first styling with built-in dark mode

## What’s Next?

This app began as a personal solution to a very specific problem and now it's something that can help others, too. By building in public, I hope to not only share what I’ve created but also invite feedback, suggestions, and even contributors.
