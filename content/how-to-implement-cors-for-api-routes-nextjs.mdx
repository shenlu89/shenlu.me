title: How to Implement CORS for API Routes in Next.js
date: "2024-06-09"
---

Recently I published [Amazing Endemic Species](https://aes.shenlu.me), a Species-as-a-Services application,
which provides other developers with a set of APIs being used in secondary development.

For testing, I plan to use these APIs in `Not Found` page of [shenlu.me](https://shenlu.me). However, I met some error when
I used these APIs.

---

## Problem #1: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' Header

```js
Access to fetch at 'http://aes.shenlu.me/api/v1/random' from origin 'http://localhost:1200' has been blocked by CORS policy:
Response to preflight request doesn't pass access control check: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present on the requested resource.
If an opaque response serves your needs, set the request's mode to 'no-cors' to fetch the resource with CORS disabled.
```

There are two ways to solve this problem:

- Define CORS in `headers` in configuration file, `next.config.js`
- Create a middleware to handle the request

### Define CORS in `headers` in configuration file

I used this method and configure `next.config.mjs` in
[Amazing Endemic Species](https://github.com/shenlu89/amazing-endemic-species/blob/main/next.config.mjs) like below.

```js
const nextConfig = {
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: "/api/v1/:slug",
        headers: [
          {
            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Origin",
            value: "*", // Set your origin
          },
          {
            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
            value: "GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS",
          },
          {
            key: "Access-Control-Allow-Headers",
            value: "Content-Type, Authorization",
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below.
};
```

After this configuration, `shenlu.me` in local, `https://localhost:3000`, will normally get the data from API service,
`https://aes.shenlu.me/api/v1/random`.

### Create a middleware to handle the request

The secondary way I did not use, you can check this link, https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/52933, to figure out.

## Problem #2: `next/image` Un-configured Host

Another error I got is when I directly passed `https://aes.shenlu.me/images/**.jpg`,
the value get from `http://aes.shenlu.me/api/v1/random`, to `src`. To solve this problem,
I defined `hostname`, `aes.shenlu.me`, in the `images.remotePatterns` in `next.config.js`.

```js
const nextConfig = {
  // Optionally, add any other Next.js config below.
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "aes.shenlu.me",
        port: "",
        pathname: "/images/**",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

After solving this problem, I finished the `Not Found` page as below:
