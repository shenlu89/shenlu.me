title: Use Environment Variables in Next.js

During the week, I was working on the new project, [Wildlife in China](https://wildlifeinchina.org).
In development process, I simply directly connected Vercel Postgres with Prisma in Next.js.
However, the Hobby plan of Vercel Postgres has [usage limits](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-postgres/usage-and-pricing#pricing) and I almost exceeded the data transfer limits.
To save the amount of data transfer, I have to connect local Postgres with the project for testing and debuging.
So I think I should use environment variables to distinguish between the development and production environments automatically.

## `.env*` Files and Environment Variables

As the documentation said, if the environment variable `NODE_ENV` is unassigned, Next.js automatically assigns development when running the `next dev` command, or production for all other commands.

So you can create a `.env.development` for development environment and add local PostgreSQL variable in it.

```sh
# Postgres
POSTGRES_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxx@localhost:5432/postgres"
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="postgresql://postgres:xxx@localhost:5432/postgres?pgbouncer=true&connect_timeout=15"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="postgresql://postgres:xxx@localhost:5432/postgres"
POSTGRES_USER="postgres"
POSTGRES_HOST="localhost"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="xxx"
POSTGRES_DATABASE="postgres"
```

And create a `.env.production` for production environment and add Vercel Postgres variable in it.

```sh
# Postgres
POSTGRES_URL="************"
POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL="************"
POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING="************"
POSTGRES_USER="************"
POSTGRES_HOST="************"
POSTGRES_PASSWORD="************"
POSTGRES_DATABASE="************"
```

After that, when running `next dev`, the Next.js project will automatically load environment variables from `.env.development`.
Or if deploying Next.js project to production environment, it will loading production environment variables from `.env.production` by default.

You can also add the environment variables shared between development and production environments in `.env` file, which will be loaded wherever the environments are.

```sh
# Postgres
NEXT_PUBLIC_IMAGES_URI = **********
NEXT_PUBLIC_ICON_URL = **********
```

## Conclusion

Now it will not waste the usage limits of Vercel Postgres when developing project in local.
