title: Best Practice for Pull Requests on GitHub
date: "2022-11-19"

Previously, I wrote an [article](https://www.shenlu.me/blog/contributing-open-source-projects-in-2021) summarizing the open-source projects I participated in and my experiences in 2021.
However, it was more of a rough summary without specific details on the actual workflow.
Coincidentally, recently I came across a GitHub project (https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/) and found a small issue in it.
Following the basic collaboration workflow recommended by GitHub,
I submitted an issue and a Pull Request (PR) to the project.

After two days, the author provided feedback and merged my PR.
Taking this opportunity, I summarized the complete workflow for collaborating on projects through GitHub, based on the open-source collaboration process provided by GitHub Docs and my practical experience.
This workflow is not only applicable to individuals contributing to open-source projects but also suitable for collaboration within companies or teams for Git projects.

## Github Workflow for Collaborating on Projects

### 1. Finding projects

Finding a target project is straightforward, in this case: https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io.

> Before making open-source contributions, it's a good idea to check if anyone has already raised similar feedback or submitted similar modifications in the issues and PRs.
> Pay attention to how the author responded to avoid wasting your time.
> If it's a minor issue and you have limited time, you can start by creating an issue to notify the author or others about the problem.
> If there is no response, you can then try submitting a PR.
> In this case, I have already opened an issue here: https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/issues/550

### 2.Forking a repository

Go to the main page of the project at https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io.
Click on the **"Fork"** button to create a new fork of the project.

After clicking the **"Fork"** button, click on the **"Create fork"** button to create the forked project in your own workspace.

### 3.Cloning a fork

Go to your GitHub workspace and clone the forked project to your local machine or remote server.
You can refer to the detailed instructions provided in the GitHub documentation at https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects for the steps to clone a repository from your GitHub account.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:shenlu89/leerob.io.git
```

### 4.Creating a branch

```sh
git checkout -b delete-unused-link
```

### 5.Make changes

To delete the unnecessary line of code import `Link from 'next/link'`

### 6. Pushing changes

This step requires attention because some projects may have frequent updates.
Before making modifications and submitting a PR, it's possible that there may be new commits and merged PRs in the original project.
If this situation occurs, your forked project in your workspace will show that the original project has been updated. For example:

![](/images/content/best-practice-for-pull-requests-on-github/v2-50161493436a34796e05fb946368a6b7_720w.png)

After clicking **"Update branch"**, the changes from the original project (https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) will be synchronized with your forked project (https://github.com/shenlu89/leerob.io).
Now, navigate to your local project folder.

```sh
git stash
git pull
git stash pop
```

Check if the updated content conflicts with your local modifications.
If conflicts exist, resolve them. Once resolved, you can proceed with submitting your modifications.

```sh
git commit -am 'Delete unused Link declaration'
git push --set-upstream origin delete-unused-link
```

### 7.Create a pull request

Go back to the workspace of your online forked project.
You will see the new branch and the merged commit information for your modifications.
Click on **"Compare & pull request"**.

Choose the branch of the original project that you want to merge into.
Provide a title and description for the pull request.
If there is a corresponding issue, you can add it by typing **"#"** (GitHub will automatically display a list of issues).

![](/images/content/best-practice-for-pull-requests-on-github/v2-8eebfb4c7744463f88cf2dbe555d1d1b_720w.png)

Click on **"Create pull request"**. The result will be as follows:

### 8. Address review comments

This part is the set of guidelines that the original project author needs to follow, and [Lee Robinson](https://leerob.io) also provided a polite response.

### 9.Merge your pull request

This step is to be carried out by the original project author, as previously demonstrated, and it will not be reiterated.

### 10.Delete your branch

The final step is not mandatory but serves as a good practice for maintaining a standardized open-source collaboration workflow and reducing the occurrence of accidentally committing to the wrong project branch.

Go to the main page of the original project on GitHub. Locate the previously merged pull request (in the closed PR list), and click on **"Delete branch"**.

![](/images/content/best-practice-for-pull-requests-on-github/v2-04351c3253b921f063eaaa06951a5c85_720w.png)

```sh
git branch -d delete-unused-link
```

> Note: Before creating a new branch in an existing forked project, it is important to sync the updates from the original project to the forked project.
> Pull the updated forked project to your local machine using `git pull`, and then create a new branch using `git checkout -b new-branch-name`.
> Repeat the aforementioned process after creating the new branch.
