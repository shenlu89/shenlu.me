title: Managing PostgreSQL with TablePlus

After setting up local `PostgreSQL`, I'm looking for a SQL GUI tool to help me manage relational databases, such as `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`.
The first tool I used is `pgAdmin4`, but when I launch it, it can not be opened and throw errors:

And then I tried to solve this problem but failed finally. Thus, I gave up to use it and turn to other tools.

## Why TablePlus

Finally I decided to choose `TablePlus` as the GUI tool of managing database. The reasons are:

1. It is cross-platform tool for Mac, Linux and Windows.
2. It has elegant UI and uses easily.
3. It supports multiple databases including MySQL and PostgreSQL.

On `Ubuntu 22.04`, you can run the commands below to install `TablePlus`:

```sh
# Add TablePlus gpg key
