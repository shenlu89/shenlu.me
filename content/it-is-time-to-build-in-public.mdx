After being a part-time independent developer for one year, I decided to adopt the **Build in Public** approach to develop my own products,
By publicly sharing the development process, I hope to document my Indie Developerial journey and inspire other aspiring entrepreneurs.

## What Is Building in Public (BIP)?

I think there is no exact definition of **Build in Public**. Based on my understanding,
**Build in Public** refers to an intentional practice of sharing the story or process of your creation with the public.

## What Are the Benefits of Building in Public?

Unlike stealth strategy (that avoid public attention and keep all the details in secrecy), **BIP** are open and transparent about their creation progress.

- **1. Increase Transparency and Gain User Trust**: By regularly sharing project progress and key decisions during the development process,
  users can see the growth process of the product, which enhances their trust in it.
- **2. Obtain Community Feedback to Optimize the Product**: Through **BIP**, we can receive timely feedback from users and the community,
  helping us identify issues and find ways to improve. User needs and suggestions are critical for product iteration.
- **3. Build a Personal Brand and Increase Exposure**: Publicly developing a product helps to build a personal brand and allows more people to learn about and pay attention to your product.
  This not only aids in product promotion but also attracts potential investors and partners.
- **4. Document and Share the Entrepreneurial Journey to Inspire Others**: Entrepreneurship is a challenging journey. By documenting and sharing my experiences and lessons,
  I can provide reference and inspiration for other entrepreneurs, encouraging more people to pursue their dreams.

## Why I Choose to Build in Public?

This mouth I launched a project, [Amazing Endemic Species](https://github.com/shenlu89/amazing-endemic-species), and received 7 stars, some feedback and thousands of vistors.
My previous projects I published never received more than 5 stars, the reason I guessed is that I never propagated them in public before.
Thus, I think sharing projects would help enhance the promotion of the projects.

Moreover, Now I have a plan to develop some new projucts, which give me a good chance to sharing project progress regularly,
and enough time to process the feedbacks from users and community. I really expected to interact with users and dicuss about
my products.

In terms of building a personal brand, I don't expect too much.
My main goal is to attract more users' attention to my products rather than focusing on my personal life.

At last, I believe that documenting and sharing the journey of being a solo maker is a good way to connect with my products users and other entrepreners.
