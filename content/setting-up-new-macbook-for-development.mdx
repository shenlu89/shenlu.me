Recently I buy a new [14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple M3 Pro chip](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m3-pro):

- 11-Core CPU
- 14-Core GPUs
- 18GB Unified Memory
- 512GB SSD Storage

I used it for two weeks with great experience, especially in its speed.

## Softwares Installation

To migrate development environment from **Ubuntu** to **MacOS**, I installed almost softwares I used in **Ubuntu**. However,
Some of them can not be used in **MacOS** directly, for which I need find the alternatives and extra configuration, like terminal on **MacOS** with **iTerm2** as an alternative. 

- [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [TablePlus](https://tableplus.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser-tools/)
- [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/download)
- [KeyCastr](https://github.com/keycastr/keycastr)

## Keyboard Shortcut

After migrating development environment for **Ubuntu** to **MacOS**, I also need get used to new keyboard shortcut on **MacOS** with deliberate practice.
