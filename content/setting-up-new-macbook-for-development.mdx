Recently I buy a new [14-inch MacBook Pro with Apple M3 Pro chip](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-pro/14-inch-m3-pro):

- 11-Core CPU
- 14-Core GPUs
- 18GB Unified Memory
- 512GB SSD Storage

I used it for two weeks with great experience, especially in its speed.

## Softwares Installation

To migrate development environment from **Ubuntu** to **MacOS**, I installed almost softwares I used in **Ubuntu**. However,
Some of them can not be used in **MacOS** directly, for which I need find the alternatives and extra configuration, like terminal on **MacOS** with **iTerm2** as an alternative. 

- [**Oh My Zsh**](https://ohmyz.sh/): A delightful community-driven framework for managing your zsh configuration.
- [**iTerm2**](https://iterm2.com/): A terminal emulator for Mac OS X that does amazing things.
- [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): A lightweight but powerful source code editor which runs on your desktop and is available for Windows, macOS and Linux.
- [**TablePlus**](https://tableplus.com/): Modern, native, and friendly GUI tool for relational databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite & more.
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/): Docker helps developers bring their ideas to life by conquering the complexity of app development.
- [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser-tools/): A web browser developed by Google.

## Keyboard Shortcut

After migrating development environment for **Ubuntu** to **MacOS**, I also need get used to new keyboard shortcut on **MacOS** with deliberate practice.
