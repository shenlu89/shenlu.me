Recently I am working on a site. The most tedious work is generating and collecting data. Today I list some frequently used Linux commands for manipulating CSV files.

## Delete the Nth Column

Here is the example that If you want to delete the 12th column in CSV file

```sh
cut -d, -f12 --complement older.csv > newer.csv
```

## Add Line Number As First Column

```sh
 awk '{printf "%s,%s\n", NR,$0}' older.csv > newer.csv
```

## Delete First Column

```sh
sed -r 's/^[^,]+,//' older.csv > newer.csv
```

## Copy images from one folder to another

```sh
find /one/folder -iname \*.jpg -print0 | xargs -I{} -0 cp -v {} /another/folder
```
