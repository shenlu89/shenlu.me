title: Upgrade Blog to Next.js 13.4

On Thursday, May 4th 2023, Vercel released the next generation of Next.js 13.4.0, which is the stable and ready for production.
So I can not wait to upgrade my blog with the new version.

## App Router

File-system based routing has been a core feature of Next.js, which is stable now.
There was nothing additional to configure. Just drop files inside `app/` and the Next.js app router would take care of the rest.
Not only defining layouts, nesting pieces of UI as layouts, but you can define not found, loading and error states.

The files structure under `app/` directory in this blog:

```sh
.
├── about
│   └── page.tsx
├── api
│   └── views
│       └── [slug]
│           └── route.ts
├── blog
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── [slug]
│       └── page.tsx
├── globals.css
├── highlighting.css
├── icon.svg
├── layout.tsx
├── [...not_found]
│   └── page.tsx
└── page.tsx
```

By the way, `Metadata` API is my favorite part.
