title: Setting up SSH and Git on MacOS
date: "2024-08-01"

After receiving my new Macbook, I started setting up a development environment on **MacOS**.
To set up **Git** on **MacOS**, I generated a new **SSH** key on my Mackbook and
added it to my **GitHub** account to enable authentication for **Git** operations over **SSH**.

## 1. Generating a new SSH key

I open a terminal and paste the text below to generate a new **SSH** key:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@example.com"
Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/Users/shenlu/.ssh/id_ed25519):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /Users/shenlu/.ssh/id_ed25519
Your public key has been saved in /Users/shenlu/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:kWkioRYSeKUUpNBRckvF/JGfJ+wfcu2FrtE6/TYgrr0 your_email@example.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ED25519 256]--+
|=+B=*+.  .       |
|o+oB oo oo       |
|..+ o ..=+ .     |
| .   . o..= .    |
|        S. o . . |
|          o.ooo .|
|          .+o=o. |
|          ..oo+..|
|         ..E+o oo|
+----[SHA256]-----+
```

The `-t` flag sets the encryption algorithm to `ed25519`. It was prompted to enter a passphrase.
Replace `your_email@example.com` with your **GitHub** account email. 
The `-C` flag adds a comment or label to identify the key, and using an email address is common. 

> Ed25519 is a public-key signature system and elliptic curve signing algorithm that uses EdDSA and Curve25519.

## 2. Adding a new SSH key to the GitHub account

To copy the public key to your clipboard, you can do the following:

```bash
pbcopy < ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
# Copies the contents of the id_ed25519.pub file to your clipboard
```

>If pbcopy isn't working, you can locate the hidden `.ssh` folder, 
open the file in your favorite text editor, and copy it to your clipboard.

Paste the public key into your **GitHub** settings. You can do this by:
- 1. Opening **GitHub** and logging in
- 2. Navigating to Settings
- 3. Clicking **SSH** and **GPG** keys
- 4. Clicking `New SSH key`
- 5. Entering a title for the key
- 6. Pasting the key into the Key section
- 7. Clicking `Add SSH Key`
- 8. Entering your account password if prompted

## 3. Git Configuration

Install **Homebrew** if you don't already have it, then:

```bash
brew install git
```

**Git** configuration settings with the git config command. 
One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Shen Lu"
git config --global user.email shenlu89dev@gmail.com
```

Check if **Git** can normally connect with your **GitHub** account with **SSH**:

```bash
ssh -T -p 443 git@ssh.github.com
The authenticity of host '[ssh.github.com]:443 ([20.205.243.160]:443)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:+DiY3wvvV6TuJJhbpZisF/zLDA0zPMSvHdkr4UvCOqU.
This host key is known by the following other names/addresses:
    ~/.ssh/known_hosts:1: github.com
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? yes
Warning: Permanently added '[ssh.github.com]:443' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
Hi shenlu89! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

Now you can freely use **SSH** to authenticate **Git** operations.
