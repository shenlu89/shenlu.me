As more and more people visited my blog, I reached the limit of data ingestion of at the end of August.

In order to continue supervising the web traffic of my blog, I decided to replace `Vercel Analytics` with `Google Analytics`.

## Create Google Analytics Account

Firstly, I need a new account of google analytics. I had one, so I just need create an new `id` or use the `id` I created before.
For those who do not have google analytics account yet, you can read these toturials,
[Google Analytics for Beginners](https://analytics.google.com/analytics/academy/course/6)

## Test Google Analytics in Development Environment

For decoupling the Google Analytics ID with JSX page in Next.js, I set `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID` as environment variable in `.env.development` file

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID='GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_MEASUREMENT_ID'
```

and copy `MEASUREMENT ID` into it.

And substitute `Vercel Analytics` with a code snippets from `View tag instructions` as below:

```js
{/* <!--  import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'; --> */}
import Script from 'next/script'

export default function RootLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body
        suppressHydrationWarning={true}
        className={`flex flex-col h-screen ${fonts.className}`}
      >
      ...
        {/* <!--  <Analytics /> --> */}
        {/* <!-- Google tag (gtag.js) --> */}
        <Script async src={`https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID}`}/>
        <Script id='google-analytics'>
          {`window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
              function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
              gtag('js', new Date());
              gtag('config', '${process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID}');
          `}
        </Script>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

## Deploy Google Analytics on Production Environment

Setting the environment variable, `NEXT_PUBLIC_ANALYTICS_ID` with `MEASUREMENT ID`, in production,
which will automatically inject `MEASUREMENT ID` in the rigit position of the page
after pushing source code to GitHub repository, [https://github.com/shenlu.me](https://github.com/shenlu.me).
