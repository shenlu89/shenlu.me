As a high-level language, the R language has unique syntax.
This is an important reason why I hate R language. Because many of the syntaxes of R can't be used in other languages, we need to remember a bunch of parameters that can only be used in R.
For example, assignment symbol in R. In other languages, this symbol is usually represented by an equal sign (`=`), while in R language, the arrow sign (`<-`) undertakes this task.
And in most cases, the equal sign and arrow can achieve the same effect.
I really don't understand why it has to work in this way.
After investigation, I summarized several differences between the operators `<-` and `=` in the R language.

I am quoting an explanation of the difference between the equal sign and the arrow from the [Assignment Operators](https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/base/html/assignOps.html) in R-manual.

> There are three different assignment operators: two of them have leftwards and rightwards forms.
> The operators `<-` and `=` assign into the environment in which they are evaluated.
> The operator `<-` can be used anywhere, whereas the operator `=` is only allowed at the top level (e.g., in the complete expression typed at the command prompt) or as one of the subexpressions in a braced list of expressions.

## Variable Assignment And Passing Arguments

In most programming languages, the equal sign (`=`) has two functions: **variable assignment** and **passing arguments**.
The equal sign (`=`) can be used for assigning variables, and can also play the role of passing arguments in Functions. For example:

```r
> a = 2 # assiging a variable
> a
[1] 2
> read.table("fileName", header = TRUE) # passing a argument
> header
Error: object 'header' not found
```

But the arrow sign (`<-`) in R does not work like this.
It has only one function: variable assignment.
Assume that only the equal sign (`=`) is used in all cases.
However, if you use the arrow (`<-`) when passing arguments in Functions, you will find that there will be an additional variable with the same assignment value as the parameter name in the global variable.
It will lead to ambiguity and occupy the namespace. For example:

```r
> b <- 2 # assign a variable
> b
[1] 2
> read.table("fileName", header <- TRUE) # assign a variable
> header
[1] TRUE
```

But the arrow sign (`<-`) is not useless. It has a capability that the equal sign (`=`) does not have: **two-way assignment**.
Since it is an arrow sign (`<-`), it should be directional.
In the R language, the arrow sign (`<-`) can not only be assigned to the left like the equal sign (`=`) but also to the right. For example:

```r
> b <- 2 # assign a variable
> b
[1] 2
> 3 -> a # assign a variable
> a
[1] 3
```

However, the arrow sign (`<-`) usually does not use like this, which is not conducive to code reading and maintenance.
Only just the arrow sign (`<-`) does have such a function in R.

## Operator Precedence

When the equal sign (`=`) and arrow sign (`<-`) exist at the same time, the precedence of `<-` is higher than `=`. For example:

```r
> x = y = 1
> x
[1] 1
> y
[1] 1
> x <- y <- 2
> x
[1] 2
> y
[1] 2
> x <- y = 3
Error in (x <- y) = 5 : object 'x' not found
> x = y <- 4
> x
[1] 4
> y
[1] 4
```

We can see that `<-` has higher precedence than `=` and execute first when processing continuous assignment.

## Conclusion

That's all my understanding of the equal sign (`=`) and arrow sign (`<-`) of R language in detail. As for how to choose, it depends on your habits.
