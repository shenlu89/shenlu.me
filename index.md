Hi, I'm Shen Lu. In May 2016, I graduated from [Iowa State University (ISU)](https://www.iastate.edu/){:target="_blank"} and received bachelor's degree on [Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCBIO)](https://catalog.iastate.edu/azcourses/bcbio/){:target="_blank"} from [College of Liberal Arts and Sciences](https://las.iastate.edu/){:target="_blank"}. 

After graduation, I tried several major-related jobs and spend around 3 years in Wuhan and Beijing. The most funny thing is that I still had no exact idea what my major does. I feel being tired of the day-by-day routine work and losing my passion on it. So I quitted my job from [ICG](https://icg.pku.edu.cn/en/){:target="_blank"} and [BIOPIC](https://biopic.pku.edu.cn/english/){:target="_blank"}, both are affiliated with [Peking University](http://english.pku.edu.cn/){:target="_blank"}, in May 2020. 

Now my new interests is web development, data visualization and discrete mathematics. By the way, I still have the plan to further my education in the US. Unfortunately, My undergraduate GPA is very low (2.12/4.0) and it's hard to apply for a good graduate school. So I need work hard to achieve this goal right now. Moreover, thanks to all the people who helped me before.

Little hungry people are physically hungry, The great hungry is a person who is hungry for survival. Why do we live, What is the significance of living? People who are always looking for these answers. This kind of person is really hungry, They called the great hungry.
